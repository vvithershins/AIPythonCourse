# Day 1: Introduction to Python

What We'll Cover:
Today, we'll embark on our journey to learn Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages in the world. Python's simple syntax and readability make it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.

Lesson:
Python is known for its readability and ease of use. Let's begin by writing a simple "Hello, World!" program:

```python
Copy code
print("Hello, World!")
```
Explanation:

`print()` is a built-in Python function used to output text to the console.

`"Hello, World!"` is a `string literal` enclosed in double quotes.

Common Errors:

Forgetting to enclose strings in quotes will result in a syntax error.
Misspelling the function name or using incorrect syntax will also cause errors.


Challenge for Day 1:
Write a Python script that modifies the "Hello, World!" program to print your own custom message instead of "Hello, World!". For example, you can print "Welcome to Python!" or any other message of your choice.
