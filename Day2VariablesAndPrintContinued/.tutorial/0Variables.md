# Day 2: Variables and Printing

Welcome to Day 2 of our Python journey! Today, we'll dive deeper into the world of variables. 

Variables are used to store and manipulate data in Python. We'll focus on two common types of variables: strings (text) and numbers (integers and floats).

Variables in Python can hold different types of data. Let's start by declaring some variables and printing their values:

```python
# String variable
name = "Alice"
print("Name:", name)

# Integer variable
age = 25
print("Age:", age)

# Float variable
height = 5.8
print("Height:", height)
```

Explanation:

String Variable (name):

We declare a variable name and assign it the value "Alice".
The print() function is used to display the value of the name variable. We include a label "Name:" to provide context.

Integer Variable (age):

We declare a variable age and assign it the value 25.
The print() function is used to display the value of the age variable. We include a label "Age:" to provide context.

Float Variable (height):

We declare a variable height and assign it the value 5.8.
The print() function is used to display the value of the height variable. We include a label "Height:" to provide context.

These examples demonstrate how to declare variables and print their values using the print() function. We have variables representing a person's name, age, and height, each assigned a different data type (string, integer, and float, respectively).
