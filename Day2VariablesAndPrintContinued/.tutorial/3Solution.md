# Solution

```python
# Declare variables
name = "vvithershins"
age = 31
height = 6.0

# Print variable values
print("| Name : ", name, "| Age : ", age, "| Height : ", height, "|")
```
In this solution:

We declare variables name, age, and height.
Each variable is assigned a value: "vvithershins" for name, 31 for age, and 6.0 for height.
We use the print() function to display the values of these variables, separated by pipes (|) for formatting.
