# Day 3: Input and User Interaction

In Day 3, we'll delve into accepting user input and interacting with the user through the `input()` function. This will allow us to create programs that can respond dynamically to user actions and inputs.

The `input()` function is used in Python to accept user input from the keyboard. It prompts the user to enter a value, which can be stored in a variable for further processing.

Here's a basic example of how to use the input() function:

```python
# Accept user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Print the input back to the user
print("Hello,", name, "! Nice to meet you.")
```
In this example:

The `input("Enter your name: ")` statement prompts the user to enter their name. Whatever the user types in response will be stored in the name variable.

The `print("Hello,", name, "! Nice to meet you.")` statement then prints a greeting message to the user, including the name they entered.
