# Common Errors

One common error when using the input() function is forgetting to convert the input to the appropriate data type. By default, input() returns a string, so if you're expecting a numeric input, you'll need to convert it using functions like int() or float().

```python
# Accepting a number as input
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```
