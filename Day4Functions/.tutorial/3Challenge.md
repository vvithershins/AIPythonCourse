Your challenge for today is to create a simple program that defines a function to calculate the area of a rectangle. The function should accept the width and height of the rectangle as parameters and return the area.

Here's a suggested outline:

Define a function called calculate_area() that takes two parameters: width and height.
Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = width * height.
Return the calculated area from the function.
Call the function with different values for width and height and print the result.
