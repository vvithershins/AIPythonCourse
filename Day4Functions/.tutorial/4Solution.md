```python
def calculate_area(a,b):
  answer = a * b
  print(answer)

calculate_area(1,2)
calculate_area(2,4)
```

This code defines a function called calculate_area() that accepts two parameters (a and b) representing the width and height of a rectangle, calculates the area using the formula area = width * height, and prints the result.
