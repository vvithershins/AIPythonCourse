# Day 4: Functions and Modules

In Day 4, we'll explore the concept of functions and modules in Python. Functions allow us to encapsulate reusable blocks of code, while modules enable us to organize our code into separate files for better maintainability and reusability.

A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help us avoid repetitive code and make our code more modular and easier to understand.

Here's how you define and use a function in Python:

```python
# Define a function
def greet(name):
    """Greets the user by name."""
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Call the function
greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```

In this example:

We define a function called greet() that takes one parameter (name) and prints a greeting message.
We call the greet() function twice, passing different names as arguments.
