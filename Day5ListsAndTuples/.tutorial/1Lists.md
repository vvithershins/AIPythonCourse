# Lists

A list in Python is a mutable, ordered collection of items. Lists are created using square brackets `[]` and can contain elements of different data types.

Here's how you create and work with lists in Python:

```python
# Creating a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Accessing elements in a list
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 1
print(fruits[1])   # Output: banana

# Modifying a list
fruits.append("orange")   # Add an element to the end of the list
fruits.remove("banana")   # Remove a specific element from the list
print(fruits)   # Show the updated list
```
