# Tuples

A tuple in Python is an immutable, ordered collection of items. Tuples are similar to lists, but they cannot be modified after creation.

Here's how you create and work with tuples in Python:

```python
# Creating a tuple
point = (10, 20)

# Accessing elements in a tuple
print(point[0])  # Output: 10
```
