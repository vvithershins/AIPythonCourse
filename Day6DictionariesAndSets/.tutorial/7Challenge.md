# Challenge

Write a program that allows users to add new items and their quantities to a dictionary. The program should prompt the user to enter an item and its quantity, then add it to the dictionary.

Here's a revised outline for the program:

Initialize an empty dictionary to store the items and quantities.
Prompt the user to enter an item and its quantity.
Add the item and quantity to the dictionary.
Print out the contents of the shoppinglist.

That concludes the lesson for Day 6! Tomorrow, we'll cover if else statements.
