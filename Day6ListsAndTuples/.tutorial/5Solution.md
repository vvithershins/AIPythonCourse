# Solution

```python
# Favorite Movies
Movies = ["The Wizard of Oz","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", "The Phantom Tollbooth"]

print(Movies)

# Access specific parts of the list
print(Movies[0],Movies[2])


# Coordinates
xandyandz = (1,3.5,1.25)

print(xandyandz)

# Append a movie to the end of the list
Movies.append("The Green Mile")

print(Movies)

# Insert a movie into a specific point in the list
Movies.insert(2,"Saving Private Ryan")

print(Movies)

# Access the list, with negative index, (from the end to the start)
print(Movies[-2])
```

Your code accomplishes the following tasks:

Creates a list Movies containing your favorite movies.
Prints the list of movies and accesses specific elements in the list.
Defines a tuple xandyandz containing coordinates.
Appends a new movie ("The Green Mile") to the end of the Movies list.
Inserts another movie ("Saving Private Ryan") at a specific position in the Movies list.
Accesses an element in the list using negative indexing.
Your code demonstrates a solid understanding of working with lists, tuples, and list methods in Python. Keep up the excellent work, and feel free to ask if you have any questions or if you'd like to move on to the next part of the lesson!
